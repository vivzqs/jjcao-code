After open a mesh, check the "AGD" and "SC" beneath the "Features" label and then click the "Calc. Std. Feature". 
It will take quite a long time to get the result for dense mesh so you can work on something else and come back in few hours. 
Please let me (Ruizhen Hu <ruizhen.hu@gmail.com>) know if there is any problem.
